# love-exemplar

A minimal Love2D project demonstrating clean architecture patterns. Intended as a reference, not a game.

## Structure

```
core/lua/       Engine classes — no game knowledge (Camera, Drawer, Input, Scene,
                SceneManager, Sprite, SpriteSet, Timer, Fonts)
game/           Game-specific code (Player, GameScene)
lua/headless/   Headless test infrastructure (stubs, HeadlessInput, runner)
tests/          Test files — run with: love . --headless
assets/         Images and other assets
conf.lua        Window config; suppresses graphics/audio modules under --headless
main.lua        Entry point — canvas rendering with letterboxing, pixel-art filter
```

See [`core/lua/README.md`](core/lua/README.md) for API docs on each engine class.

## Running

```bash
love .                  # normal window
love . --headless       # run tests and exit
```

## Architecture notes

- **Fixed logical resolution** — game renders to a `1280×720` canvas; `main.lua` scales it to the window with letterboxing. Works with any window size.
- **Scene transitions** — `SceneManager` fades through black (0.3 s) between scene switches.
- **Headless tests** — `lua/headless/stubs.lua` installs no-op love API replacements so test files run without a window. `HeadlessInput` lets tests script action presses frame-by-frame. See `tests/test_basics.lua` for a minimal example.
